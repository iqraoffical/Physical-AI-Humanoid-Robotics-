## Security and Access Control

All API endpoints should implement appropriate security measures:

- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse of search endpoints
- **Authentication**: Required for update/write operations
- **Authorization**: Role-based access controls for different user types
- **Input Validation**: Sanitize all input parameters to prevent injection attacks
- **Output Encoding**: Encode responses appropriately to prevent XSS
- **CORS Policy**: Restrict cross-origin requests appropriately

This API contract defines how the Vision-Language-Action module content can be accessed and integrated with the RAG chatbot system. It provides structured access to the module's content, concepts, and learning objectives, enabling the chatbot to provide accurate, context-aware responses to questions about NVIDIA Isaac technologies for humanoid robotics.
