# Module 2: Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

## Overview
This module implements a digital twin of the humanoid robot, enabling simulation in both Gazebo and Unity environments to validate designs before physical deployment.

## Key Components
- Gazebo simulation with physics, gravity, and collision modeling
- Sensor simulation (LiDAR, Depth camera, IMU) with realistic noise characteristics
- Unity visualization for enhanced representation
- ROS 2 integration for sensor data streaming

## Status
