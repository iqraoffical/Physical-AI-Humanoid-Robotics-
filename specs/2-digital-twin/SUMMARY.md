# Module 2 Summary: Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

## Feature Overview
Module 2 establishes a digital twin environment for the humanoid robot using both Gazebo and Unity simulation platforms. This allows for validation of robot designs and behaviors in a safe, virtual environment before physical deployment.

## Key Deliverables
- Gazebo simulation environment with physics and collision modeling
- Unity visualization for enhanced representation
- Realistic sensor simulation (LiDAR, Depth camera, IMU)
- ROS 2 integration for sensor data streaming
- Documentation chapter for Docusaurus

## Dependencies
- Gazebo simulation platform
- Unity 3D for visualization
- ROS 2 Humble Hawksbill
- High-performance hardware (RTX 4070 Ti, 32GB+ RAM)

## Success Metrics
- Robot behaves realistically under physics simulation
- Sensor data streams contain appropriate noise and latency
- Unity visualization maintains 30+ FPS while synchronized with Gazebo
- Simulation maintains real-time performance for validation purposes
