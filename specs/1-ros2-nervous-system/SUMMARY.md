# Module 1 Summary: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

## Feature Overview
Module 1 establishes ROS 2 as the nervous system of the humanoid robot, providing the foundational communication infrastructure for reliable, modular, and fault-tolerant operation.

## Key Deliverables
- ROS 2 workspace with communication nodes (publisher/subscriber, services, actions)
- Humanoid URDF model for simulation and control
- Bridge between Python AI agents and ROS controllers
- Documentation chapter for Docusaurus

## Implementation Status
