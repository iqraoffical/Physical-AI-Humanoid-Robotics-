# Citation and Reference Framework

## Overview

This module follows APA citation style for referencing official NVIDIA documentation and peer-reviewed robotics research. All technical claims must be supported by official documentation or academic sources.

## Primary Sources

The module draws from several primary sources:

### NVIDIA Documentation
- NVIDIA Isaac Sim Documentation: https://docs.nvidia.com/isaac-sim/
- NVIDIA Isaac ROS Documentation: https://docs.nvidia.com/isaac-ros/
- Nav2 Documentation: https://navigation.ros.org/
- ROS2 Documentation: https://docs.ros.org/en/rolling/

### Academic Sources
- Mur, J., et al. (2017). "ORB-SLAM2: An Open-Source SLAM System for Monocular, Stereo, and RGB-D Images." IEEE Transactions on Robotics.
- Kuindersma, S., et al. (2016). "Optimization-based locomotion planning, estimation, and control design for the atlas humanoid robot." Autonomous Robots.

### Industry Research
- OpenRAVE: A planning benchmark for robotic applications (http://openrave.org/)
- CoppeliaSim: Formerly V-REP, a 3D robot simulator (https://www.coppeliarobotics.com/)
- Gazebo: Robot simulation environment (http://gazebosim.org/)

## Citation Format

When citing sources in the module content, use the following format:

- For direct quotes: (Author et al., Year, p. #)
- For paraphrased content: (Author et al., Year)
- For general references to concepts: (NVIDIA Isaac Sim Documentation, n.d.)

## Reference Management

All citations must be verifiable through the original sources. When incorporating information:

1. Always attribute the original source
2. Distinguish between NVIDIA documentation and academic research
3. Indicate when content is derived from product specifications vs. research findings
4. Include retrieval dates for online documentation

## Quality Assurance

All technical claims must be supported by at least one authoritative source. This ensures:

- Accuracy of technical information
- Consistency with NVIDIA's official documentation
- Academic rigor in the educational content
- Reliability for student learning outcomes

## Note on Vendor Focus

Consistent with the module's constraints, this framework emphasizes NVIDIA Isaac ecosystem documentation while maintaining academic rigor through peer-reviewed research citations. No vendor comparisons outside NVIDIA Isaac are included in the citation framework.
