# ROS 2 Core Concepts

## Nodes and Communication

### ROS 2 Nodes
In ROS 2, a node is a process that performs computation. Nodes are the fundamental building blocks of ROS 2 applications and are designed to be modular and reusable.

### Communication Patterns
ROS 2 supports several communication patterns:
- **Topics**: Publish/subscribe communication for streaming data
- **Services**: Request/response communication for synchronous operations
- **Actions**: Goal/cancel/result communication for long-running tasks

## Parameters and Configuration

### Parameter Management
ROS 2 provides a robust system for managing parameters that can be set at runtime, allowing for flexible configuration of robot systems without recompilation.

### Launch Files
Launch files allow you to start multiple nodes with a single command, along with their configurations, parameters, and remappings.

## Quality of Service (QoS)

### QoS Policies
ROS 2 introduces Quality of Service policies that allow fine-tuning of communication behavior:
- Reliability (reliable vs. best effort)
- Durability (transient local vs. volatile)
- History (keep last vs. keep all)

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, students should be able to:
1. Create and implement ROS 2 nodes
2. Understand and use different communication patterns
3. Configure nodes using parameters
4. Apply appropriate QoS policies for different use cases
