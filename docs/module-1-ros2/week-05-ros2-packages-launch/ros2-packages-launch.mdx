# ROS 2 Packages and Launch Systems

## Package Structure

### ROS 2 Package Organization
A ROS 2 package contains the source code, configuration files, and dependencies needed for a specific functionality. The standard structure includes:
- `CMakeLists.txt` or `setup.py` for build configuration
- `package.xml` for metadata and dependencies
- Source code in appropriate language-specific directories
- Configuration and launch files

### Creating Packages
Using `ros2 pkg create` to initialize new packages with proper structure and build system configuration.

## Launch Systems

### Launch Files
Launch files in ROS 2 are written in Python and provide a powerful way to start multiple nodes with specific configurations.

### Launch Arguments
Parameterizing launch files to make them more flexible and reusable across different environments and configurations.

### Composable Nodes
Running multiple nodes within a single process to reduce overhead and improve performance.

## Testing and Quality Assurance

### ROS 2 Testing Framework
Tools and practices for testing ROS 2 packages, including unit tests, integration tests, and system tests.

### Code Quality Standards
ROS 2 follows specific coding standards and practices to ensure maintainability and interoperability.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, students should be able to:
1. Create and structure ROS 2 packages properly
2. Write launch files for complex multi-node systems
3. Use launch arguments for flexible system configuration
4. Implement testing strategies for ROS 2 packages
