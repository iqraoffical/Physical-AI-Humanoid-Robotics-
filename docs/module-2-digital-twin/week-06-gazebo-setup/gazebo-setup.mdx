# Gazebo Simulation Environment Setup

## Introduction to Gazebo

Gazebo is a 3D simulation environment that enables accurate and efficient testing of robot algorithms, design of robots, and performance evaluation of different configurations. It provides high-fidelity physics simulation, realistic rendering, and convenient programmatic interfaces.

## Installation and Configuration

### System Requirements
- Compatible operating systems (Ubuntu, macOS, Windows)
- Graphics hardware with OpenGL support
- Sufficient computational resources for physics simulation

### Installation Process
Detailed steps for installing Gazebo and verifying the installation.

## Basic Simulation Concepts

### Worlds and Models
- Creating and loading simulation worlds
- Adding and configuring robot models
- Physics properties and material definitions

### Sensors and Actuators
- Implementing realistic sensors in simulation
- Configuring actuators and joint controllers
- Sensor noise models and realistic behavior

## Integration with ROS 2

### Gazebo ROS 2 Packages
- Using `gazebo_ros_pkgs` for ROS 2 integration
- Controlling robots through ROS 2 topics and services
- Publishing sensor data through ROS 2 topics

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, students should be able to:
1. Install and configure Gazebo for robot simulation
2. Create basic simulation worlds with robot models
3. Integrate Gazebo with ROS 2 systems
4. Implement basic robot control in simulation
