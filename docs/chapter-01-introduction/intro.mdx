# Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to **Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics: Embodied Intelligence in the Physical World**. This comprehensive textbook covers the intersection of artificial intelligence and physical systems, with a focus on humanoid robotics.

## Course Overview

This course is structured as a 13-week program that builds from fundamental concepts to advanced implementations:

- **Weeks 1-2**: Physical AI Foundations and Embodied Intelligence
- **Weeks 3-5**: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)
- **Weeks 6-7**: Digital Twin Implementation
- **Weeks 8-10**: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)
- **Weeks 11-13**: Vision-Language-Action Systems and Conversational Robotics

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

1. Understand the fundamental principles of embodied AI and physical intelligence
2. Implement and operate robotic systems using ROS 2
3. Design and validate robot systems using digital twin technology
4. Develop perception and navigation systems using NVIDIA Isaac technologies
5. Integrate vision, language, and action systems for conversational robotics
6. Apply sim-to-real transfer techniques for robotic systems

## Target Audience

This course is designed for:
- Graduate students studying AI and robotics
- Researchers working on embodied AI systems
- Engineers developing humanoid robots
- Anyone interested in the intersection of AI and physical systems

## Prerequisites

Students should have:
- Basic programming experience (Python preferred)
- Understanding of linear algebra and calculus
- Familiarity with basic robotics concepts (helpful but not required)

## Getting Started

Begin with Module 4 (Weeks 1-2) to establish the theoretical foundations, then proceed through the modules in sequence to build a complete understanding of physical AI systems for humanoid robotics.
