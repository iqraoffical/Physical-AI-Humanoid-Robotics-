# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics: Table of Contents

Welcome to **Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics: Embodied Intelligence in the Physical World**, a comprehensive textbook covering the intersection of artificial intelligence and physical systems, with a focus on humanoid robotics.

## Book Structure

This textbook is organized into interconnected modules that build upon each other to provide a comprehensive understanding of physical AI systems:

### [Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)](/docs/book/module-1-ros2/nervous-system)

Establishes ROS 2 as the foundational communication infrastructure that enables reliable, modular, and fault-tolerant operation of humanoid robots. This module covers node architecture, communication patterns, and integration with AI systems.

### [Module 2: Digital Twin Implementation](/docs/book/module-2-digital-twin/digital-twin)

Explores the creation and implementation of digital twin systems using Gazebo and Unity for simulation and validation of robot designs before physical deployment, including sensor simulation and physics accuracy.

## About This Book

This textbook combines theoretical foundations with practical implementation guidance, providing readers with both conceptual understanding and hands-on experience in developing intelligent physical systems. Each module includes implementation details, educational objectives, integration points, and quality assurance guidelines.

## Target Audience

This book is designed for:
- Graduate students studying AI and robotics
- Researchers working on embodied AI systems
- Engineers developing humanoid robots
- Anyone interested in the intersection of AI and physical systems

## Getting Started

Start with Module 1 to understand the foundational concepts, then proceed through the modules in sequence to build a complete understanding of physical AI systems for humanoid robotics.
