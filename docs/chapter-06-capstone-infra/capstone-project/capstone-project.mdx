# Capstone Project: Integrating Physical AI Systems

## Capstone Project Overview

The capstone project integrates all concepts learned throughout the course into a comprehensive physical AI system. Students will design, implement, and evaluate a complete humanoid robot system that demonstrates:

- ROS 2-based communication and control
- Digital twin simulation and validation
- NVIDIA Isaac-based perception and navigation
- Vision-language-action integration
- Conversational robotics capabilities

## Project Requirements

### Technical Requirements
- Multi-sensor integration and fusion
- Real-time perception and decision making
- Safe and robust operation
- Human-robot interaction capabilities

### Evaluation Criteria
- System performance in simulation and reality
- Technical innovation and implementation quality
- Documentation and reproducibility
- Presentation and demonstration

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this capstone, students should be able to:
1. Integrate multiple AI and robotics technologies
2. Design and implement a complete robotic system
3. Validate system performance in simulation and reality
4. Document and present technical work effectively
