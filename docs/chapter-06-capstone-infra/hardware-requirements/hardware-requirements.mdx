# Hardware Requirements for Physical AI Systems

## Computing Requirements

### NVIDIA Jetson Platforms
For edge AI and robotics applications, we recommend:
- Jetson AGX Orin (preferred for humanoid robots)
- Jetson Orin NX (balance of performance and power)
- Jetson Nano (for simpler applications or prototyping)

### Alternative Computing Platforms
- NVIDIA RTX GPUs for simulation and training
- Industrial PCs for stationary systems
- Custom embedded solutions for specialized applications

## Robot Hardware Platforms

### Humanoid Robot Options
- Unitree H1 (affordable humanoid platform)
- Tesla Optimus (advanced research platform)
- Custom robotic platforms

### Sensor Requirements
- RGB-D cameras (Intel RealSense, Azure Kinect)
- LiDAR sensors (Hokuyo, Ouster, Velodyne)
- IMU sensors for balance and orientation
- Force/torque sensors for manipulation
- Additional tactile and proprioceptive sensors

## Simulation Hardware

### Graphics Requirements
- NVIDIA RTX 3080 or higher for photorealistic simulation
- VR/AR capabilities for immersive development
- Multi-monitor support for development workflows

## Network and Infrastructure

### Communication Infrastructure
- High-speed Ethernet for robot systems
- WiFi 6 for wireless communication
- Real-time communication protocols
- Network security for multi-robot systems

## Learning Objectives

By understanding hardware requirements, students should be able to:
1. Select appropriate hardware for their robot applications
2. Balance performance, cost, and power requirements
3. Design robot systems with appropriate sensing capabilities
4. Plan infrastructure for robot development and deployment
