# Physical AI Foundations

## Introduction to Physical AI

Physical AI represents a paradigm shift from traditional AI systems that operate in digital spaces to AI systems that interact with and understand the physical world. This module introduces the fundamental concepts that underpin intelligent physical systems.

## Key Concepts

### Embodied Cognition
The theory that cognitive processes are deeply rooted in the body's interactions with the environment. In robotics, this translates to designing systems where intelligence emerges from the interaction between computation, body, and environment.

### Embodied Intelligence
Systems that exhibit intelligent behavior through their physical embodiment and interaction with the world, rather than just through abstract computation.

### Sensorimotor Contingencies
The relationship between sensory inputs and motor outputs that forms the basis for understanding the environment through action.

## Physical AI vs. Traditional AI

Traditional AI systems operate primarily in digital spaces, processing symbolic information without direct interaction with the physical world. Physical AI systems, in contrast, must handle:

- Real-time processing constraints
- Uncertainty and noise in sensor data
- Continuous interaction with dynamic environments
- Embodiment constraints (physics, energy, materials)

## Applications of Physical AI

- Humanoid robotics
- Autonomous vehicles
- Industrial automation
- Assistive robotics
- Search and rescue systems

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, students should be able to:
1. Distinguish between traditional AI and Physical AI
2. Explain the concept of embodied cognition
3. Identify applications of Physical AI systems
