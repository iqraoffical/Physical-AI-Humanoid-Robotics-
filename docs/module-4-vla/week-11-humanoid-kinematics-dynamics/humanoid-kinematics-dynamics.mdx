# Humanoid Kinematics and Dynamics

## Introduction to Humanoid Robotics

Humanoid robots are designed to mimic human form and behavior, offering unique advantages in human environments. This module explores the mathematical foundations for controlling these complex systems.

## Kinematics

### Forward Kinematics
- Mathematical representation of joint positions
- Transformation matrices and homogeneous coordinates
- Denavit-Hartenberg parameters for humanoid systems

### Inverse Kinematics
- Solving for joint angles given end-effector positions
- Analytical vs. numerical methods
- Applications in humanoid manipulation and locomotion

## Dynamics

### Rigid Body Dynamics
- Newton-Euler and Lagrangian formulations
- Equations of motion for multi-body systems
- Joint space vs. operational space dynamics

### Humanoid-Specific Dynamics
- Balance and stability considerations
- Center of mass control
- Zero moment point (ZMP) for bipedal locomotion

## Control Strategies

### Operational Space Control
- Controlling end-effectors in Cartesian space
- Task-space vs. joint-space control
- Handling kinematic and dynamic constraints

### Balance Control
- Feedback control for maintaining stability
- Center of pressure management
- Ankle, hip, and stepping strategies

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, students should be able to:
1. Apply forward and inverse kinematics to humanoid systems
2. Understand the dynamics of multi-body systems
3. Implement basic balance control strategies
4. Design controllers for humanoid manipulation tasks
