# Embodied Intelligence and Sensors

## Introduction to Embodied Intelligence

Embodied intelligence is the idea that intelligence emerges from the interaction between an agent and its environment, mediated by its physical form and sensorimotor capabilities. This week explores how physical embodiment shapes intelligent behavior.

## Sensor Systems in Robotics

### Types of Sensors
- Proprioceptive sensors (internal state)
- Exteroceptive sensors (environment perception)
- Tactile sensors (contact and force)
- Range sensors (LiDAR, ultrasonic, structured light)

### Sensor Fusion
Combining data from multiple sensors to create a more complete and reliable understanding of the environment than any single sensor could provide.

## Perception and Action Loop

### The Perception-Action Cycle
The continuous loop of sensing, interpreting, planning, and acting that characterizes embodied systems. Unlike traditional AI systems that process inputs to produce outputs, embodied systems maintain ongoing interaction with their environment.

### Affordances
The possibilities for action that the environment offers to an embodied agent. Understanding affordances is crucial for intelligent physical interaction.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, students should be able to:
1. Understand the perception-action cycle in embodied systems
2. Explain the role of sensor fusion in robotic intelligence
3. Identify different types of robotic sensors and their applications
4. Describe the concept of affordances in physical interaction
