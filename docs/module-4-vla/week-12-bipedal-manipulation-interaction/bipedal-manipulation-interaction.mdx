# Bipedal Manipulation and Human-Robot Interaction

## Bipedal Locomotion

### Walking Patterns
- Static vs. dynamic walking
- Gait generation and control
- Terrain adaptation for bipedal robots

### Balance and Stability
- Real-time balance control
- Disturbance rejection
- Multi-contact scenarios and recovery strategies

## Manipulation in Humanoid Systems

### Dual-Arm Manipulation
- Coordination of multiple manipulator arms
- Whole-body manipulation strategies
- Task allocation between arms and torso

### Grasping and Manipulation
- Adaptive grasping strategies
- Object manipulation with humanoid hands
- Tool use and dexterous manipulation

## Human-Robot Interaction

### Social Robotics
- Understanding human social cues
- Appropriate robot responses and behaviors
- Safety considerations in human-robot interaction

### Collaborative Robotics
- Shared control between humans and robots
- Intent recognition and prediction
- Intuitive interfaces for robot control

## Integration Challenges

### Whole-Body Control
- Coordinating locomotion and manipulation
- Managing multiple simultaneous tasks
- Computational efficiency for real-time control

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, students should be able to:
1. Implement basic bipedal walking controllers
2. Design dual-arm manipulation strategies
3. Understand principles of human-robot interaction
4. Address integration challenges in whole-body control
